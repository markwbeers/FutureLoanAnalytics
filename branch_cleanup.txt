Part 1: Automate the Calculations

        There are 5 loans in this portfolio.
        Total amount lent out by this portfolio is $ 2,750.00
        The average loan size in this portfolio is $ 550.00






Part 2: Analyze Loan Data

        GIVEN LOAN DATA:

        1. The 'Future Value' of the loan is $ 1,000.00
        2. There are 9 months left until this loan matures.
        3. The 'Annual Interest Rate' of the $ 500.00 loan is 20.0%

        The 'Present Value' of the loan is $ 861.77 which is a.k.a its 'Fair Value'

        Therefore the 'Fair Value' of this loan is $ 861.77

        Since the 'Present Value' of $ 861.77 is equal to or greater than its purchase price of $ 500.00,

        The loan is worth buying at the price of $ 500.00.

Part 3: Perform Financial Calculations

        GIVEN LOAN DATA:

        1. The 'Future Value' of the loan is $ 1,000.00
        2. There are 12 months left until this new loan matures.
        3. The 'Annual Interest Rate' of the new loan for $ 800.00 is 20.0%

        ̲S̲O̲L̲U̲T̲I̲O̲N̲:̲

        The present value of the new loan is: $820.08

Part 4: Conditionally filter lists of loans

        First we are given a loan inventory to evaluate to determine which loans are 'inexpensive'.
        'Inexpensive' is defined as having a 'loan price' less than or equal to $500
        The inventory is in the form of a list of 4 loans.

        To solve, we iterate over the list to find the 'inexpensive loans'.

        The 2 'inexpensive loans' in the portfolio are:

        $ 500
        $ 200


Part 5: Save the results

The final step in this challenge is to save our results by writing a .csv file named 'inexpensive_loans.csv'

From the original 4 loans in the given portfolio, we are asked to save the 'inexpensive loans' only.

.̲.̲.̲ ̲S̲A̲V̲I̲N̲G̲ ̲T̲H̲E̲ ̲'̲2̲ ̲i̲n̲e̲x̲p̲e̲n̲s̲i̲v̲e̲ ̲l̲o̲a̲n̲s̲'̲ ̲s̲h̲o̲w̲n̲ ̲b̲e̲l̲o̲w̲ ̲u̲s̲i̲n̲g̲ ̲c̲s̲v̲ ̲m̲o̲d̲u̲l̲e̲ ̲i̲n̲ ̲P̲y̲t̲h̲o̲n̲.̲

Detailed Information of Inexpensive Loans being saved in CSV file:
Loan Price: $500, Remaining Months: 13, Repayment Interval: End-term Lump Sum, Future Value: $1000
Loan Price: $200, Remaining Months: 16, Repayment Interval: End-term Lump Sum, Future Value: $1000
